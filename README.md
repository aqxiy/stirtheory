sTir Theory 

Ever wonder about the tantalizing prospect of consistently & efficiently achieving homogenization within a simple 50mL beaker on magnetic stirrer setup?

sTir Theory: Key to simple homogenization lies in dynamic, optimally integrative stir modulation. Beaker, water, stirbar proportions. Combine aforementioned with target to preempt formation of clusters and 
otherwise & inclusive accelerate homogenization. 

Supporting:

The nature of the solution as a whole is influenced by each interaction between stirbar and fluid. And the effect of every interaction between stirbar and fluid is a product of composite rotational momentum of the solution interacting with velocity fluctuations of the stirbar. Modulate velocity dynamically & potentially interactively for superior solution homogeneity.

My cognitive path here:

I've been enthralled with stir speeds modulation as a route towards solution homogenization since observing and subconsciously tinkering with, now I have word basis to work with:

Different stir orientations better for different things for some reason

You want to influence collision nature at different concentrations and points in mixing process to ensure evenness

Vectorize around difference force distributions in solution

Stir modulation, force derivatives incurred by jolts redefines solution character, shapes formed, ala

Influencing force probability pressure interaction essential

There's a general approach, and one with video analysis & derived input
